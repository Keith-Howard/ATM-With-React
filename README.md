# ATM-With-React

This is an ATM program written using React. You have to select either deposit or withdraw from a dropdown menu then type the amount you want. Press submit and the balance is updated. If you try to withdraw too much money and alert will appeaer telling you that you have "insufficient funds".

# Installation
To run this program
Make sure you have Node.JS installed on your computer.
Download the JavaScript, HTML and CSS files from the repository.
Click on the file and open the ATM.HTML file in your browser.

# Road Map
Improvements I made were adding an alert to tell you that you did not have enough funds for a withdrawel. I added validation like disabling the submit button if you did not enter a number greater than 0 and if you did not select a transaction type in the drop down. I repalced buttons on the application with a dropdown menu. The buttons were calculating the balance without having to click the submit making the submit button redundant.
